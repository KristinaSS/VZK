The processing of data by Facebook takes place within the framework of Facebook's data usage guidelines. Accordingly, general information on the display of Facebook ads is provided in the Facebook Data Usage Policy: https://www.facebook.com/policy.

<h3>a.</h3>
If we have collected your e-mail address in the context of the purchase of one of our services, we may send you promotional e-mail messages about our own products and service similar to those you’ve already purchased. <strong>You can object to receiving such promotional e-mail messages at any time at no cost by sending an e-mail to newsletter@g2esports.com. </strong>We will inform you about the right of objection when collecting the email address and within each e-mail sent. The legal basis of data processing is art. 13 par. 2 of dir. 2002/58/EC and the respective implementing provisions in German law (§ 7 par. 3 UWG).
<h3>b.</h3>
You can subscribe to our newsletter by entering your e-mail address in the respective form or by checking the respective check-box upon registration of your user account. You will then receive an automatic confirmation e-mail to the address you entered, which contains a link. The registration process is only completed once you confirm it by navigating to that link. We use your email address to send you promotional content and offers about our own services and those of partner companies. The data will not be passed on to third parties. You can withdraw your consent to receive newsletters at any time without stating reasons by following the instruction provided in each newsletter sent, or by sending us an unambiguous notice at <strong>newsletter</strong><strong>@g2esports.com</strong><strong>.</strong> We will inform you about the right to withdraw your consent upon subscription to the newsletter service and within each newsletter sent. Our newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use our mailing service provider Salesforce.com (provided by Salesforce.com Germany GmbH, Erika-Mann-Str. 31, 80636 Munich, Germany), from their server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information such as information on the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are initially collected.
